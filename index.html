                    <p1>THE PROBLEM: 
                        Travellers these days do a lot of research while planning their itinerary. They have a hard time collating ratings and reviews over various websites/apps.
                        
                        THE SOLUTION: 
                        To provide an app where users can see all the required information at a glance for their ease in comparison.

                    <h3>Canada Post Case Study</h3>
                    <p1>
                        For this project we closely studied the UI Elements of the present Canada Post website and mobile app.
                        We conducted the heuristic evaluation of the website and also analysed its navigation. We also did the card sorting before redesigning the user interface.
